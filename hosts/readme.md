# Hosts blocker

This is a simple hosts generator that takes the combination of multiple hosts
files and combines them into one. This does not any unique hosts of their own

You can either use the hosts file hosted
[here](https://michaelbitokhov.com/hosts) or make your own hosts file by
running blocker.py and it'll drop a hosts file in this directory. But plans
exist in using argparse to provide good amount of options

These is all the sources I've used in making the hosts file. Please consider
dropping them a thank you note
